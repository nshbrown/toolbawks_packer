= Toolbawks Packer - Installation Directions

1. Create your Rails application, set up your databases.

2. Install the Toolbawks Core (it will install Engines if it doesn't already exist)
	
	script/plugin install http://svn.toolbocks.com/plugins/toolbawks_packer/

	a) If you didn't have engines already installed, add the following within the 
		 "Rails::Initializer.run do |config|" block in config/environment.rb

    config.plugins = ["engines", "*"]

3. For good measure, you should update your JavaScript's to the latest version of Prototype and Scriptaculous.

  rake rails:update:javascripts
